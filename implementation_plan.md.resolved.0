# Point C Scout - Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Build "Point C Scout," a B2B Sales Intelligence Tool designed for simplicity and financial safety. The tool automates lead discovery, profiling, and drafting using a single-tenant architecture hosted on Cloud Run with Google Sheets as the database.

## Architecture & Safety
- **Database:** Google Sheets (Master Sheet: Leads, Logs, DNC_List) via `st.connection`.
- **Financial Safety (Circuit Breakers):**
    - `max_retries=3` on API calls.
    - Daily Soft Cap: $15 (Alert).
    - Monthly Hard Cap: $200 (Stop Processing).
- **Security:** Single-Tenant, No PHI allowed.

## Proposed Changes

### Project Structure
- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application entry point.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `modules/`: Contains the 5 core logic modules.
    - `hunter.py`: Discovery logic (Serper, News).
    - `profiler.py`: Analysis logic (Gemini, Regulatory Focus Theory).
    - `ghostwriter.py`: Drafting logic (Gemini, RAG).
    - `command_center.py`: UI components.
    - `circuit_breaker.py`: Safety and cost management.
- `utils/`: Helper functions.
    - `gsheets.py`: Database interactions.
    - `msgraph.py`: Outlook integration.
    - `serper.py`: Search API wrapper.
- `config/`: Configuration and settings.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- Unit tests for Circuit Breaker logic (mocking API calls to verify caps).
- Integration tests for Google Sheets connection (verify read/write).

### Manual Verification
- **Circuit Breaker Test:** Manually trigger the daily cap limit to verify alert generation.
- **End-to-End Flow:** Run a "Sniper Mode" search -> Profile -> Draft -> Approve (Mock push).
