# Scout Dashboard - Walkthrough

## Overview
The **Scout Dashboard** is now live on Google Cloud Run! It provides a secure, "premium" interface for the sales team to view lead intelligence, export data, and retry failed generations.

## Access
- **URL:** [https://scout-dashboard-283427197752.us-central1.run.app](https://scout-dashboard-283427197752.us-central1.run.app)
- **Password:** `scout2025`
- **Compatibility:** Works on Desktop and Mobile.

## Features

### 1. The "Sisyphus" Interface
- **Dark Mode Aesthetic:** Deep navy background with high-contrast text.
- **Unified Cards:** Lead details are presented in clean, expandable cards.
- **Status Badges:** Quick visual indicators for DISC types and lead status.

### 2. Lead Intelligence
Expand any row to see:
- **Dossier Summary:** DISC type, Communication Style, Hooks, and Pain Points (formatted as clean text).
- **Draft Email:** A pre-written cold email tailored to the lead's psychology.
- **LinkedIn Profile:** Direct link and profile photo (if available).

### 3. "Retry" Generation
If a lead is missing a Draft Email (due to API rate limits):
1. Expand the lead's card.
2. Click the **"🔄 Retry Generation"** button.
3. The AI will re-process just that lead and refresh the page automatically.

### 4. Data Export
- **Export All:** Click the sidebar button to download the entire dataset as CSV.
- **Export Single:** Click "⬇️ Download CSV" inside any card to get just that lead's data.

### 5. Bulk Actions & Integrity
- **Fix Incomplete Leads:** A sidebar button to auto-regenerate all leads missing data or emails.
- **Integrity Check:** A sidebar button to audit the database, flagging leads where the current role on LinkedIn doesn't match the target firm.

### 6. Manual Overrides
- **Edit Data:** Expand any lead card and scroll to "Manual Updates" to fix Email Addresses or LinkedIn URLs directly.
- **Email Guessing:** The system now auto-guesses missing emails (labeled with `[guess]`) and provides a reason.

## Deployment Details
- **Platform:** Google Cloud Run (Serverless)
- **Security:** Publicly accessible URL, protected by application-level password.
- **Updates:** To deploy changes, run [./deploy.sh](file:///Users/josephlf/.gemini/antigravity/brain/02e59244-ce52-4904-b156-ca810a595f5c/deploy.sh) from your terminal.

## Troubleshooting
- **"Forbidden" Error:** If you see this, it means you are accessing an old cached version. **Hard Refresh** (Cmd+Shift+R) or open in Incognito mode.
- **Missing Data:** Use the "Retry" button. If it persists, check the Google Sheet for valid LinkedIn URLs.
